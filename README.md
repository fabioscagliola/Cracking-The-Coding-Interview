# Cracking the Coding Interview 

189 programming questions and my solutions in C# 

## Chapter 1 – Arrays and Strings 

### 1.1 Is Unique 

Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you cannot use additional data structures? 

### 1.2 Check Permutation 

Given two strings, write a method to decide it one is a permutation of the other. 

### 1.3 URLify 

Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'. You may assume that the string has sufficient space at the end to hold the additional characters, and that you are given the "true" length of the string. 

### 1.4 Palindrome Permutation 

Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palindrome. A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same forwards and backwards. A permutation is a rearrangement of letters. The palindrome does not need to be limited to just dictionary words. You can ignore casing and non-letter characters. 

### 1.5 One Away 

There are three types of edits that can be performed on strings: insert a character, remove a character, or replace a character. Given two strings, write a function to check if they are one edit (or zero edits) away. 

### 1.6 String Compression 

Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters. For example, the string `aabcccccaaa` would become `a2b1c5a3`. If the "compressed" string would not become smaller than the original string, your method should return the original string. 

### 1.7 Rotate Matrix 

Given an image represented by an N x N matrix, where each pixel in the image is represented by an integer, write a method to rotate the image by 90 degrees. Can you do this in place? 

### 1.8 Zero Matrix 

Write an algorithm such that if an element in an M x N matrix is 0, its entire row and column are set to 0. 

### 1.9 String Rotation 

Assume you have a method `isSubstring` which checks if one word is a substring of another. Given two strings, `s1` and `s2`, write code to check if `s2` is a rotation of `s1` using only one call to `isSubstring` (e.g., "waterbottle" is a rotation of "erbottlewat"). 

## Chapter 2 – Linked lists 

### 2.1 Remove Dups 

Write code to remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list. How would you solve this problem if a temporary buffer is not allowed? 

### 2.2 Return Kth to Last 

Implement an algorithm to find the kth to last element of a singly linked list. 

### 2.3 Delete Middle Node 

Implement an algorithm to delete a node in the middle (i.e., any node but the first and last node, not necessarily the exact middle) of a singly linked list, given only access to that node.
